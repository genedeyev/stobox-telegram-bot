# Stoby — build roadmap

Stoby is the resident AI of the Stobox community. This tracks what's shipped and
what's planned. "Shipped" = in `main`, tested, golden-gated.

> **🟢 LIVE in production** — Railway (worker) + Supabase (pgvector), running
> 24/7. Handle `@stobox_assistant_bot`, display name "Stoby | AI Assistant".
> Persisted state on an `/app/data` volume. Waves 1 & 2 complete.

## ✅ Shipped

**Core** — grounded RAG with citations, 3-block compliance prompt (CORE +
CANONICALS + FRESHNESS), deterministic rails, golden-gate regression suite,
confidence gating, self-updating knowledge (stobox.io llms.txt + site crawl +
GitHub), hot-reload docs watcher.

**Conversation** — human/emotional v3 answers, English-only, adaptive depth,
**short answers with progressive disclosure** (📖 More detail / 📩 Email me this
/ 💬 Continue in DM buttons), instant "checking the docs…" placeholder, share
buttons, community-QA canonical answers, **interactive /guide** (button-navigated
user tour), Stoby identity (name/description/command-menu set via Bot API).

**Community & growth** — new-member welcome, deep-link attribution + referral
tracking (`/stats`), blog auto-announcements (OG cards), native polls, share
nudges, unanswered-question loop (capture → notify → `/answer`/`/approve` →
deliver, mirrored to stobox-v15 register), opt-in migration reminders
(`/remindme`), **email follow-up** (`/email` → detailed write-up via SMTP or
CRM lead handoff).

**Moderation** — 4-layer stack (deterministic filters + LLM classifier + strike
ledger + severity policy), impersonation defense, mod-log with Pardon/Ban
buttons, admin commands (`/warn /mute /ban /strikes /modstats`…), `/appeal`.

**Ops** — rate limiting + spend cap, `/pause` kill switch, self-update webhook +
daily cron, preflight doctor, Railway + Supabase deploy (LIVE).

## 🔜 Planned

### Wave 2 — the Stobox-specific engagement engine  ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **On-chain wallet migration checker** — SHIPPED. `/check 0x…` (or just paste
  an address) reads the 4 eligible STBU contracts across Ethereum/BNB/Polygon/
  Arbitrum via public RPC → per-chain balances + exact migration path. Read-only,
  never touches keys; a pasted private key triggers a compromise warning.
- ✅ **AMA collector** — SHIPPED. /amaopen [topic] announces to groups; members
  submit with /ama (similar questions merge = implicit upvote); everyone upvotes
  with a 👍 button (toggle); /amalist + /amaclose hand you a vote-ranked list.
  `engagement/ama.py`. Zero-effort AMA prep.
- ✅ **Quiz nights + XP / streaks / leaderboard** — SHIPPED. Native Telegram quiz
  polls (auto-scored via PollAnswer, +10 XP for correct), XP for helpful
  questions/referrals/daily streaks, levels (Newcomer→Community OG), /rank +
  /leaderboard (weekly), admin /quiz. `engagement/xp.py`.
- **Referral leaderboard** — monthly recognition on top of the existing ref
  tracking; measurable K-factor.

### Wave 3 — revenue & retention depth
- ✅ **AXIS pre-qualifier in chat** (`/qualify`) — 5-tap fit check → banded signal
  (strong / promising / early) → routes to the real free Readiness Score at
  stobox.io/compass, captures a scored warm lead + optional `/email` handoff.
  It's a light indicator, never a fabricated AXIS result or pricing promise.
- ✅ **Case-study & jurisdiction matcher** (`/resources`, + a button on the AXIS
  result) — maps an issuer's asset + jurisdiction to the right PUBLISHED Stobox
  resources (Readiness Score, STV3/ERC-3643 learn page, Intelligence) with
  grounded, promise-free framing. Never fabricates case studies or legal
  conclusions; always defers to counsel + the Readiness Score.
- 🟡 **Lead handoff** — until the CRM is connected, a qualified MQL is (a) emailed
  as a summary to <b>info@stobox.io</b> (via Resend or SMTP) AND (b) DM'd to admins
  in Telegram once — a zero-config safety net so no lead is missed even if email
  isn't set up yet. Users are routed to self-serve: product (app.stobox.io), the
  contact form (stobox.io/contact), and the free Readiness Score (stobox.io/compass).
  **Twenty CRM**: set `CRM_WEBHOOK_URL` when ready — the same MQL then also POSTs
  there (one-line switch, kept for the testing phase).
- ✅ **Topic subscriptions** (`/subscribe migration|rwa-news|product`) — opt-in,
  DM-only, toggle-button UI; new blog posts are keyword-routed to a topic and
  DM-pushed only to that topic's subscribers, each with a one-tap way out.
- ✅ **Win-back** DMs — one gentle, value-first check-in for topic subscribers
  who've gone quiet (14-day inactive, opt-in only, 45-day cooldown, one-tap out).

### Wave 4 — ops polish
- ✅ **Content flywheel** (`/content`) — recurring community questions (esp. the
  low-confidence gaps) become deterministic blog-outline briefs, filed as
  GitHub issues on the content repo (dedup via persisted theme keys). Admin
  preview by default; `/content file` opens issues; weekly preview DM'd to admins.
- ✅ **Real-time FUD/sentiment alarm** — the router tags every message's
  sentiment (frustrated / angry / anxious / fud / toxic); Stoby de-escalates
  with a calm, human reply (facts only), AND a coordinated-FUD spike (N flagged
  messages in a short window, per-chat, cooldowned) now DMs admins immediately —
  even when Stoby stays silent publicly — so a human can step in fast.
- ✅ **Analytics dashboard UI** — a self-contained, theme-aware HTML dashboard at
  `GET /insights` (community health, top questions, doc gaps, potential leads,
  languages, moderation), rendered from the live decision log. Auto-refreshes;
  gate behind auth in production.

### Group hygiene (live)
- ✅ **Deleted-account removal** — Stoby auto-kicks ghost "Deleted Account"
  members the moment they surface (join / status change), and admins can
  `/cleanup` (reply to a ghost) to remove one on the spot. Count shows in
  `/modstats`. Detection is conservative (empty name + no username/last-name,
  never a bot). Note: the Bot API can't list all members, so there's no bulk
  one-shot sweep of pre-existing ghosts — they're cleared as they surface.

### Rational, humanized engagement (live)
- Stoby decides per message whether to **answer**, **calm the room**, or **stay
  out** — untagged, it engages on questions/Stobox-relevant messages and on
  Stobox-directed FUD/heat, but stays quiet on pure chatter and unrelated spats.
- Moderation still runs first (spam/scam/slurs); mild rudeness that isn't
  bannable gets a calm boundary instead of a doc-dump or silence.

### Context, memory & control (live)
- ✅ **Internal message log** — every group message Stoby sees is recorded
  (append-only JSONL, age-pruned to ~90 days + per-chat ceiling, compacted on
  load). Admin audit via `/log [N]` and `/whosaid <term|@user|reply>`.
- ✅ **Long-term recall** — when answering a group question Stoby pulls up to 4
  relevant older messages (keyword overlap, beyond the working window) so he can
  reference things said weeks ago. Config `message_log.recall`.
- ✅ **Never-miss questions** — deterministic backstop: a trailing `?` or opening
  interrogative always engages, independent of classifier variance.
- ✅ **Admin by @username** — `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_USERNAMES` (plus the secure
  `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_USER_IDS`); `/userid` grabs a numeric ID for the ID-based route.
- ✅ **Quiet-chat blog sharing + back-off** — surfaces a rotated real blog post
  when a chat goes still (~3h), goes dormant after unanswered nudges, skips night.
- ✅ **Link discipline + human voice** — max 1–2 official links, no URL menus;
  the `/qualify`, `/resources`, `/contact` messages de-menued to conversational.
- ✅ **Privacy/retention controls** — `memory.retain_questions` /
  `max_recent_questions` bound per-user retention.

### Requested backlog
- ✅ Shorter answers + ask-if-more + DM offer + email offer — **shipped**.
- Semantic recall (embeddings over the message log) — sharper than keyword recall.
- Multimodal ingestion of inbound images/voice.
- Discord / Slack adapters (interface ready).
